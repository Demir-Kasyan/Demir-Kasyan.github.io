                <p>As you may know, the Angular covered in this book is a descendant of an earlier
                    framework called “AngularJS”. This can sometimes be confusing, particularly when
                    reading supplementary blogs or documentation.
                    The official branding guidelines state that “AngularJS” is a term reserved for
                    AngularJS 1.x, that is, the early versions of “Angular”.
                    Because the new version of Angular used TypeScript (instead of JavaScript) as the
                    primary language, the ‘JS’ was dropped, leaving us with just Angular. For a long time
                    the only consistent way to distinguish the two was folks referred to the new Angular
                    <br><br>
                    However, the Angular team in 2017 switched to semantic versioning with a new
                    major-release upgrade slated for every 6 months. Instead of calling the next versions
                    Angular 4, Angular 5, and so on, the number is also dropped and it’s just Angular.
                    In this book, when we’re referring to Angular we’ll just say Angular or some-
                    times Angular X, just to avoid confusion. When we’re talking about “the old-style
                    JavaScript Angular” we’ll use the term AngularJS or AngularJS 1.x.</p>

                <p>Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California.
                    Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock.
                    They incorporated Google as a California privately held company on September 4, 1998, in California.
                    <br><br>
                    Google was then reincorporated in
                    Delaware on October 22, 2002. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters
                    in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a
                    conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet
                    interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. In 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union
                    was founded, mainly composed of Google employees.</p>
